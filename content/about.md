Hey Folks!
I'm Shrishti Vaish and I'm delighted that you visited my page.
Currently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science with Honours from the University of Delhi, India. During my final year at college, I had developed keen interest in Data Science knowing its worth and demand in the coming future. 

No better tool that I can find other than R is for statistical analysis. I use R extensively for any of my data science projects. 

Well, I am new to blogging and will be posting about a lot of it. 

Thank You!
