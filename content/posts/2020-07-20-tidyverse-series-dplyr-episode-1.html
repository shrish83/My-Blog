<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this series, we are going to talk about data manipulation in R. The data we obtain or collect from various sources is usually unstructured or comprises information that is futile for our purpose. Therefore, spending time on the entire dataset is needless and inessential.</p>
<p>So, <strong>Data Manipulation</strong> is the key. We transform our data according to our needs which is significant for robust analysis. We <em>manipulate</em> data for further easy processing.</p>
<p>R has many built-in libraries and functions for our desired task.</p>
<p>In this episode, we start with the widely used <strong>tidyverse</strong> which <em>is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="tidyverse" class="section level1">
<h1>tidyverse</h1>
<p>The <em>tidyverse</em> is an umbrella term comprising many packages for data interaction. Let’s learn its installation process which similar to any other installation.</p>
<p>Also load it into your R session.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)

library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>There are four main packages for <em>Data wrangling and Transformation:</em>
* dplyr
* tidyr
* stringr
* forcats</p>
<p>We are going to learn about the <strong>dplyr</strong> package in depth in this episode.</p>
</div>
<div id="dplyr" class="section level1">
<h1>dplyr</h1>
<p>dplyr is a <em>grammer of data manipulation providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;)

<h4>Choosing dataset</h4>
<p>Using <code>data()</code> to reveal in-built datasets.
In this tutorial, we are going to use the <code>Titanic</code> dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#data()

</div>
<div id="viewing-the-description-of-the-dataset" class="section level4">
<h4>Viewing the description of the dataset</h4>
<pre class="r"><code>str(Titanic)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  &#39;table&#39; num [1:4, 1:2, 1:2, 1:2] 0 0 35 0 0 0 17 0 118 154 ...

</div>
</div>
<div id="the-pipe-function---a-better-alternative" class="section level1">
<h1>The <code>pipe</code> Function - a better alternative</h1>
<p>All the functions take the dataset as the first argument. Using the <code>%&gt;%</code> operator that is the <code>pipe</code> operator makes our working easier. For instance, an argument or the dataset <code>x</code> in some <code>function(x,y)</code> becomes <code>x %&gt;% function(y)</code> which means that results from previous steps can be piped into another or the next steps.</p>

<p><strong>Note: The similarities in all of the above functions is their syntax like the dataset as their first argument which can be piped as well and the next set of arguments as to what action has to be performed on the dataset, etc.</strong></p>
<p>So, this is it. We chose a simple, small dataset to start with and learnt how to manipulate data using a few simple functions.</p>
<p>You can chose any other dataset from the in-built ones or from many websites offering datasets for free. Here are some of the sites that I recommend:
<a href="https://www.gapminder.org/data/">Gapminder</a>
<a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset">Data.gov</a>
<a href="https://data.world/datasets/free">Data.world</a></p>
